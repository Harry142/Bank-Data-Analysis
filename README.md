# Bank-Data-Analysis

This repository contains the Bank Data Analysis project, which focuses on leveraging public campaign data from Kaggle to perform customer clustering for segmentation analysis. The project also demonstrates the use of SQLAlchemy for creating a dummy relational database and the execution of SQL queries using mock data.

Project Overview
The Bank Data Analysis project is aimed at providing insights into customer behavior and segmentation using data from banking marketing campaigns. It involves the following key components:

Customer Clustering:
Analysis of public campaign data from Kaggle.
Application of clustering algorithms to segment customers based on various attributes.

Database Management:
Implementation of SQLAlchemy to create a dummy relational database.
Design and structuring of database schema relevant to the banking data.

SQL Queries:
Crafting SQL queries to extract meaningful information from the mock data.
